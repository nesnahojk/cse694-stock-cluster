\textit{Since I was not sure about Carmen size limits you can find all the code and accompanying data at my Google Code repository: http://code.google.com/p/cse694-stock-cluster/source/browse/\#svn/trunk}

\subsection{Display}
\subsubsection{Main Window}
In the main window the stocks are plotted based on two principal components of the high dimensional input vector for the input data.
\subsubsection{Stability Bar Chart Windows}
\subsubsection{History Window}
\subsubsection{Keyboard Controls}
The keyboard controls are not well though out and are thus not very intuitive.

\begin{itemize}
	\item F2: advances a time step
	\item F1: decreases a time step
	\item Home: loops through cluster configurations
	\item X: zoom in
	\item Z: zoom out
	\item Arrow keys: scroll as would be expected
	\item ESC: closes the program
\end{itemize}

\section{Interesting Observations}

\section{Future Work}
This is something that I think, if refined, could have useful purposes in my forthcoming career.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Make the stability bar charts into boxplots, this would give more inferencing ablity
 \item Integrate the preprocessing into the display more smoothly
 \item More professional OpenGL features such as window resizing handling
 \item Allow selection of a stock, and watch its progression through time
 \item Apply other similarity measures
 \item Experiment with other dimensionality reduction techniques
 \item Explore other data transformations
 \item Make color assignment less arbitrary at each time step
\end{itemize}
